# Precision — The Calculator (Winning Profile)

## THE RULE (win determination — author's framework, confirmed)
The thresholds are the **average winning gaps from a survey of 700+ matches** —
every PM victory averaged into the PM prescribed gaps, every FC victory into the
FC prescribed gaps. Every single victory had this shape; the thresholds are the
average of them.

A parser **wins** only by satisfying the prescribed set under **two gates, on
each metric**:

1. **SIGN gate** — be on the correct side. Positive where the metric must be
   led (exceed metrics); within the allowed deficit band on a trail metric.
   **Wrong side (negative) = zero edge — not even "considered."** He doesn't
   have it in the slightest.
2. **THRESHOLD gate** — depends on metric type:
   - **SUCCESS metrics (must-exceed)** are **met-or-nothing**: `gap ≥ threshold`
     = edge (MET); anything less, *even positive*, = **NO-EDGE**. There is **no
     "considered" zone on success metrics** (PM and FC alike).
   - **ALLOWED-gap metrics** (the deficits a type may carry — e.g. an FC's 9+,
     steal, oppUFE; the own-error cap) are **held** while within the allowed
     band, **NO-EDGE** once breached. The tolerance lives here, not on success.

A winner must carry the **whole prescribed set** this way — **not** win on one
standout metric while underwater elsewhere. (Brooksby had a full 9+ but was
negative on conv and steal → failed the sign gate there → no winning shape → he
loses, despite the 9+.)

## Convention
Every value is a **(PM − FC) gap** in the metric's native units.
Each metric has a **pair: [when PM wins] / [when PM loses]**.

| Metric | PM wins (PM−FC) | PM loses (PM−FC) | Win-side direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1-4** (first-strike win %) | **+1.1** | **−2.3** | higher = PM |
| **Conv** (conversion) | **+1.4** | **−0.5** | higher = PM |
| **OUFE** (errors forced on opp) | **+3.5** | **+0.8** | higher = PM |
| **9+** (grind win %) | **+5.9** | **+0.6** | higher = PM |
| **Steal** (steal score) | **+3.6** | **+1.3** | higher = PM |
| **UFC** (own unforced errors) | **−3.9** | **−2.2** | lower = PM |

Decision boundary per metric = midpoint of the pair:

| Metric | midpoint (PM−FC boundary) |
|---|---|
| 1-4 | −0.60 |
| Conv | +0.45 |
| OUFE | +2.15 |
| 9+ | +3.25 |
| Steal | +2.45 |
| UFC | −3.05 |

## The pass bar — ALL-GREEN over SIX (author's calculator, IMG_1757)
**No count model. No "display-only" metric.** All **six** are gates, including
**OUFE-A** (oppUFE = adjUFE + WinUFE): **1-4, Convs, OUFE-A, 9+, Steal, UFE.**
A metric is **green** when it meets its threshold, **red** when it doesn't. A
side is a **CALL** only when **all six are green**; otherwise **NO CALL.** No
single factor wins — it's a recipe; only together they win.

*Superseded: the earlier "4-of-5 / 3-of-5 count" and the claim that oppUFE is
display-only. The author's grid gates OUFE-A and color-codes all six. Conv and
steal are gates here too — not a separate "variables" bin.*

FC thresholds (Success gap, gap = side − opp), from IMG_1757:
| metric | kind | FC threshold |
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 Rally | exceed | ≥ +2.3 |
| Convs | exceed | ≥ +0.5 |
| OUFE-A | trail | ≥ −0.8 |
| 9+ Rally | trail | ≥ −0.6 |
| Steal | trail | ≥ −3.3 |
| UFE | cap | ≤ +2.2 (engine-verified; image's +2.8 stale) |

PM thresholds carry from the calibrated calculator: 1-4 ≥ +1.1, Convs ≥ +1.4,
OUFE-A ≥ +3.5, 9+ ≥ +5.9, Steal ≥ +3.6, UFE ≤ +3.9. (PM side confirmed off the
FC-only image only where it overlaps; OUFE-A PM gate uses the verified +3.5
PM-win gap.)

## How to read it
- The **PM wins** when its (PM−FC) gaps sit on the PM side of the midpoints —
  i.e. PM is adding the strike (1-4, conv) on top of native grind (9+, steal,
  OUFE) **and** holding own errors well below the FC (UFC ≈ −3.9).
- The **FC wins** (PM-loses column) when PM gives back the strike (1-4 −2.3,
  conv −0.5), barely leads on its own turf (OUFE +0.8 / 9+ +0.6 / steal +1.3),
  and the error edge shrinks (UFC −2.2).
- The asymmetry is the architecture: **PM must win clean; FC wins while
  hitting more errors** (its UFC edge over PM is smaller).

## Resolved
- **Steal**: verified **+3.6 / +1.3** (the handwritten −5.3 is superseded).
- **UFC FC-side**: verified **−2.2** (the handwritten +2.8 is superseded;
  matches the independent charting re-derivation).
- **UFC is "must not exceed" in BOTH directions** — own unforced errors are
  flagged only when they run **too high**, never too low. It is an error CAP,
  not an exceed-target. Gap-report caps = the verified magnitudes:
  **PM ≤ +3.9**, **FC ≤ +2.2**.

## Metric → gradient (reference only; literature kept separate/proprietary)
1-4 / 9+ = Temporal · Conv = Abstract-Spatial · Steal = Concrete-Spatial ·
OUFE = Reference · UFC = Spatial.

## File → calculator mapping (Everybody Measurements)
Pull these from the file:
- **1-4** = `short_win%`
- **9+** = `long_win%`
- **ownUFE** = `adjUFE`
- **conv** (Convs) = TennisViz conversion (NOT the file's `BP_conv%` — different
  stat). Source: `Precision - Variables (TennisViz).csv`, `conv` column.
- **steal** = TennisViz steal (NOT the file's `steal_droplob` — different stat).
  Source: `Precision - Variables (TennisViz).csv`, `steal` column. conv and steal
  are **gates in the recipe**, not a separate bin.

- **OUFE-A** (oppUFE) = `adjUFE` + `WinUFE` — opponent UFE forced. This **IS a
  gate** (one of the six). The author's grid (IMG_1757) reads e.g. Zverev 17.9 =
  16.9 + ~1.0, Fritz 17.0 = 15.9 + ~1.1 — exactly adjUFE + WinUFE. The earlier
  per-match chart oppUFE values (e.g. Tien 19.4) are **superseded/wrong**; the
  computed adjUFE + WinUFE is the metric that gates.

## Baseline profiles (stand-in opponent when the competitor is unknown)
Absolute metric values for a winning PM and a winning FC. When an opponent's
metrics are unknown, fill their side with the baseline of **their** type
(your PM faces the FC baseline; your FC faces the PM baseline), then run the
normal gap profile.

| metric | PM win | FC win |
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 (r14)     | 51.3 | 50.8 |
| conv          | 70.3 | 68.8 |
| oppUFE (oufe) | 17.7 | 17.1 |
| 9+ (r9)       | 51.5 | 49.1 |
| steal         | 33.8 | 32.2 |
| ownUFE (ufc)  | 15.5 | 18.6 |

Higher = better on all except **ownUFE** (lower = better). Note the PM baseline
is the cleaner one (ownUFE 15.5 vs FC 18.6) and the heavier grinder (9+ 51.5 vs
49.1) — the architecture difference, in absolute numbers.
